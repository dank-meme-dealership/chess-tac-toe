## What is it?

Chess Tac Toe is a real-time matchmaking online version of Tic Tac Chec board game [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Handmade-Wooden-Beginners-Chess-Set/dp/B00QGOY3E8). You can join the matchmaking queue and get matched with a random opponent and play in real-time. We built this because there was no way to play with your friends remotely.

## What's next?

Most of the codebase was written in 3 days during a Hackathon. We're actively working on cleaning up the code and making the app more friendly on mobile devices, as well as squashing some bugs and implementing some niceties. Check back soon as the app will only get better and better.

## How can I help?

Sit tight for now. We need to make some improvements and once we push those changes we'll be open to feature requests and PRs.
